#Color Contrast

Color Contrast helps to determine the legibility of text based on the [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#guidelines) of text and background contrast ratios. Reading a text with enough contrast with the background can help people with moderately low vision.

Levels of contrast:
- Level AA: The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. 
- Levels AAA: The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 7:1.

(Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1)
